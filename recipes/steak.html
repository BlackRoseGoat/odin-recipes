        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>One 36-ounce porterhouse steak, cut 2 inches thick</li>
            <li>Kosher Salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Set a rack in a rimmed baking sheet. Season the steak with 1 tablespoon of salt and transfer to the rack. Refrigerate, uncovered, overnight. Let the steak come to room temperature 30 minutes before cooking.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400°. Heat a large cast-iron skillet until very hot, about 5 minutes. Pat the steak dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Cook the steak over moderate heat until browned and crusty, about 3 minutes. Add the butter, turn the meat and transfer the skillet to the oven. Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part registers 120° for medium-rare, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer the steak to a work surface and let rest for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
